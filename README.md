## Mock database to pull current user profiles and add new ones

# Purpose of Project
<details>
## - Demonstrate knowledge of React and React DOM for making fluid and appealing SPA's.

## - Work on controling the state of our user database and allowing users to add to and remove from databases.

## - Realize how multiple libraries and frameworks come together to make a cohesive product.

## - Expand my knowledge and make an actual JSON database where I can store users and remove users,add to friends,etc.
</details>

#Ideas!
<details>
 - Instead of the nav bar just displaying Logged In As:username, lets have it display the users picture and be its own dropdown menu so when a user clicks their profile picture in the right corner, they will see a user menu with different options including the sign out option and edit profile option. Maybe place cog icon nearby so user knows to click.

# Things to do! 1 = Highest Priority
<details>
## - Redirect user to their profile on successful login and reset the login form. 1

## - Fix user photos on the feed so they are uniform and all same dimensions. 5

## - Add form validation to the logins to display error messages when user types in wrong information. 4

## - Work on learning MongoDB so we can have an actual database that is persistant despite refreshing the page. 6

## - Let user click on profiles within the feed to then visit other profiles. -Partially done, will redirect to correct URL. 3

## - Allow user to sign out and then back into another profile. - Partially done, Nav bar will display user and a sign out option currently.
+ Side note lets make the Logged In As area less cluttered and off to the right of the container. 2
